# Comprehensive test suite for version string comparison algorithms
#
# The format is intended to be plain text, human readable and more or
# less easily parsable to be used in test suite of any version string
# comparison algorithm/library. It may either be used directly of
# after conversion into another machine readable format (json currently
# supported).
#
# File syntax:
# - Lines starting with # are comments and should be ignored
# - Blank lines should be ignored
# - Lines starting with [ and ending with ] denote sections
# - Other lines are test cases in format "version1" "relation sign"
#   "version2" where both versions are double quoted, relation sign is
#   one of < (less than), = (equals), and > (greater than), and these
# 	are delimited with single space characters.
# - Relations may include additional one letter flags from the list:
#   p - handle single `p` letter encountered in a version as post-release
#       keyword ("p is patch")
#   a - handle any unknown letter sequence encountered in a version string
#       as post-release keyword ("any is patch")
#   l - treat version as minimal possible version is the corresponding
#       branch ("lower bound")
#   u - treat version as maximal possible version is the corresponding
#       branch ("lower bound")
#   These flags may be added at the left or at the right of relation sign,
#   denoting that they affect corresponding (left hand side or right hand
#   side) version string. If new flags are introduced which affect
#   comparison as a whole and not specific side, these may be added at
#   the any side.
#
# Each case is expected to be symmetric (and should be checked both ways
# by test suite consumers), so there's no need to add explicit "b > a"
# cases for each "a < b".
#
# Test suite consumers may ignore section headers if they don't handle them.
# However, these may be used to exclude specific features (not supported by
# corresponding implementation) from testing.
#
# Test suite consumers may ignore any comparison flags, cases involving
# these flags or corresponding sections.
#
# Version comparison algorithm implementors are welcome to suggest new flags
# and test sections. Not supporing implementations are free to ignore these.
